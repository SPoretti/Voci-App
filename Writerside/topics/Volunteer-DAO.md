# VolunteerDao [Interface]

## Overview

`VolunteerDao` is an interface that defines the data access object (DAO) for interacting with the `volunteers` table in the local Room database. It provides methods for performing various database operations, such as inserting, updating, deleting, and querying volunteer data.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations:** Offers methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting volunteer entities in the database.
- **Data Queries:** Provides methods for querying volunteer data based on different criteria, such as ID, email, or area.

## Key Components

- **Insert Methods:** `insert` - for adding new volunteer entities to the database.
- **Update Methods:** `update` - for modifying existing volunteer entities.
- **Delete Methods:** `delete`, `deleteById` - for removing volunteer entities from the database.
- **Query Methods:**
    - `getVolunteerById`: Retrieves a single volunteer entity by ID.
    - `getVolunteerByEmail`: Retrieves a single volunteer entity by email.
    - `getAllVolunteers`: Retrieves all volunteer entities as a Flow.
    - `getAllVolunteersSnapshot`: Retrieves all volunteer entities as a List.
    - `getVolunteersByArea`: Retrieves volunteer entities filtered by area as a Flow.

## Known Limitations

- **Data Validation:** Assumes that data validation is performed before calling DAO methods.
- **Error Handling:** Does not explicitly handle database errors, relying on Room's exception handling mechanisms.

## Notes

- **Dependencies:** Relies on Room annotations and the `Volunteer` data class.
- **Future Improvements:**
    - Add data validation checks within DAO methods.
    - Implement more specific error handling for database operations.
    - Consider adding methods for more complex queries or data manipulations.
