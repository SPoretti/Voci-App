# Resource [Sealed Class]

## Overview

`Resource` is a sealed class that represents the status of a resource operation. It is used to wrap the result of an operation, indicating whether it was successful, resulted in an error, or is still loading. This provides a structured way to handle different outcomes of asynchronous operations, especially when dealing with network requests or database interactions.

## Features

- **Status Representation:** Clearly represents the status of an operation as Success, Error, or Loading.
- **Data Handling:** Encapsulates the data associated with the operation, if available.
- **Error Management:** Provides a mechanism to include error messages for failed operations.
- **Type Safety:** Ensures type safety by using generics to specify the type of data being wrapped.

## Key Components

- **`Success`:** Represents a successful operation. Holds the data retrieved or the result of the operation.
- **`Error`:** Represents a failed operation. Includes an error message and optionally the data associated with the error.
- **`Loading`:** Represents an ongoing operation. Does not hold any data or error message.

## Known Limitations

- **Basic States:** Defines three basic states (Success, Error, Loading). More complex scenarios might require additional states.

## Notes

- **Usage:** Widely used in repositories and ViewModels to handle asynchronous operations and communicate their status to the UI.
- **Error Handling:** The `Error` state allows for providing specific error messages to the UI, improving user experience.
- **Data State Management:** `Resource` can be used in conjunction with state management solutions like LiveData or Flow to observe changes in the operation status and data.
