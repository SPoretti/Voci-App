# Navigation [Package]


## Overview 

The navigation package contains the NavGraph that is described in its own file.
It used to contain the Screens.kt file as well but it was used just for the bottom bar.
At the start the Screens.kt file used to contain every route but since some routes need props we have to write them in the navGraph directly.
