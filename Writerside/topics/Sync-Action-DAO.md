# SyncQueueDao [Interface]

## Overview

`SyncQueueDao` is an interface that defines the data access object (DAO) for interacting with the `sync_queue` table in the local Room database. It provides methods for managing synchronization actions, allowing the application to track and execute pending data synchronization operations.

## Features

- **Synchronization Action Management:** Offers methods for adding, retrieving, deleting, and clearing synchronization actions in the queue.
- **Pending Action Retrieval:** Provides a way to retrieve pending synchronization actions based on a timestamp.
- **Queue Status:** Allows checking if the synchronization queue is empty.

## Key Components

- **Insertion:** `addSyncAction` - Adds a new synchronization action to the queue.
- **Retrieval:** `getPendingSyncActions` - Retrieves pending synchronization actions with a timestamp less than or equal to the provided timestamp, returning a Flow of SyncAction objects.
- **Deletion:**
    - `deleteSyncAction` - Deletes a specific synchronization action from the queue.
    - `clearAllSyncActions` - Clears all synchronization actions from the queue.
- **Queue Status:**
    - `getRowCount` - Retrieves the number of synchronization actions in the queue.
    - `isEmpty` - Checks if the synchronization queue is empty.

## Known Limitations

- **Error Handling:** Does not explicitly handle database errors, relying on Room's exception handling mechanisms.

## Notes

- **Dependencies:** Relies on Room annotations and the `SyncAction` data class.
- **Future Improvements:**
    - Implement more specific error handling for database operations.
    - Consider adding methods for more complex synchronization action management, such as updating action priorities or retry attempts.
