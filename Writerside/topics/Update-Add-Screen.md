2. **Cancel Button**:
    - A "Cancel" button to return to the previous screen without saving any changes.

## Implementation Details

- **Button Data**: A list of predefined button data is used to dynamically create the status buttons, each associated with a specific color and label.
- **Haptic Feedback**: The UI can incorporate haptic feedback to provide tactile interaction on button presses (not explicitly shown in code but typically handled by `Modifier`).
- **Accessibility**: The UI design includes basic accessibility considerations, like button labels and simple navigation for the cancel action.
- **Modularity**: The screen is modular, with a clear separation of UI components like buttons and the cancel action.
