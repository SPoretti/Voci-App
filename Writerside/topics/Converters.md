# Converters [Class]

## Overview

The `Converters` class provides methods to convert between a list of strings (`List<String>`) and a JSON string. These conversions are used by Room's `@TypeConverter` annotation to handle non-primitive types that aren't natively supported by Room, allowing the `List<String>` to be stored and retrieved from the database as a JSON string.

## Methods

### `fromJson(value: String): List<String>`

- **Description:** Converts a JSON string to a list of strings (`List<String>`).
- **Parameters:**
    - `value` (`String`): The JSON string that needs to be converted to a `List<String>`.
- **Returns:** A `List<String>` containing the values parsed from the JSON string.

### `toJson(list: List<String>): String`

- **Description:** Converts a list of strings (`List<String>`) into a JSON string.
- **Parameters:**
    - `list` (`List<String>`): The list of strings to be converted into a JSON string.
- **Returns:** A `String` containing the JSON representation of the list.

## Usage

The `Converters` class is used to convert `List<String>` objects to JSON strings and vice versa when storing data in the Room database. These type converters are particularly useful when you need to persist complex or custom data types that Room does not support out of the box.

## Known Limitations

- **JSON Structure:** The class assumes the `List<String>` is serialized as a JSON array. Complex objects within the list may require additional handling or custom converters.
- **Error Handling:** The class does not provide specific error handling, relying on Gson to handle errors in JSON parsing or serialization.

## Notes

- **Dependencies:** This class relies on the `Gson` library for JSON parsing and serialization. Additionally, it uses Room's `@TypeConverter` annotation to facilitate database conversions.

## Future Improvements

- Implement error handling to manage potential issues during JSON parsing or serialization.
- Consider supporting other complex data types, such as custom objects or lists of objects, using Gson or another serialization library.
- Add unit tests to validate that conversions work correctly, especially for edge cases such as empty lists or malformed JSON.
