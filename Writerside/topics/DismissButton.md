## Features

1. **Outlined Appearance**:
    - The button has an outlined appearance with a transparent background, making it visually less prominent than a filled button.
    - This subtle design helps to avoid overwhelming the user with visual elements.

2. **Clear Label**:
    - Displays a user-friendly text label within the button, clearly indicating the dismissal action that will be performed upon clicking.

3. **Enabled/Disabled State**:
    - The `enabled` parameter controls the button's interactivity. When disabled, the button appears visually inactive and cannot be clicked.

4. **Customization**:
    - The `modifier` parameter allows for flexible styling and positioning of the button, such as padding, margins, and alignment.
    - The `colors` and `border` parameters enable customization of the button's appearance, allowing you to adjust its color and border style to match your application's design.
