)
```

## Features

1. **Interactive Map Integration**:
    - Utilizes `MultiPointMap` to display the searched or current location.
    - Supports smooth camera animations to focus on the selected location.

2. **Search Functionality**:
    - Includes a search bar for forward geocoding.
    - Fetches the address for coordinates using reverse geocoding.

3. **Current Location Handling**:
    - Uses `LocationHandler` to fetch the device's current location.
    - Updates the map view based on the current location.

4. **Confirmation Workflow**:
    - Allows users to confirm their selected location via a dialog.
    - Provides visual feedback for the selected address.

5. **Offline Handling**:
    - Displays errors or fallback messages when location services are unavailable.

## Known Limitations

- **Dependent on Network Connectivity**:
    - Requires internet access for geocoding and map rendering.
- **Single Location Selection**:
    - Only supports one selected location at a time.

---

## Notes

- **Dependencies**:
    - Requires `MultiPointMap` and `AddLocationSearchbar` components for map rendering and search functionality.
    - Relies on `LocationHandler` for accessing the deviceâ€™s current location.
    - Utilizes `ServiceLocator` to obtain the `HomelessViewModel`.

- **Future Improvements**:
    - Add support for multiple location selections.
    - Enhance offline functionality with cached map data.
    - Improve error handling for geocoding failures.
