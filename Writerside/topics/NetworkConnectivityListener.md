# NetworkConnectivityListener [Class]

## Overview

`NetworkConnectivityListener` is a class that monitors network connectivity changes and triggers a synchronization operation when the network becomes available. It uses the `ConnectivityManager` and `NetworkCallback` APIs to detect network changes and WorkManager to schedule the synchronization task.

## Features

- **Network Monitoring:** Monitors network connectivity changes in real-time.
- **Synchronization Trigger:** Triggers a synchronization operation when the network becomes available.
- **Background Synchronization:** Uses WorkManager to perform the synchronization task in the background.

## Key Components

- **`connectivityManager`:** An instance of `ConnectivityManager` used to access network information.
- **`networkCallback`:** An instance of `NetworkCallback` that receives network connectivity change events.
- **`startMonitoring()`:** Starts monitoring network connectivity changes.
- **`stopMonitoring()`:** Stops monitoring network connectivity changes.
- **`triggerSync()`:** Triggers a synchronization operation using WorkManager.

## Known Limitations

- **WorkManager Dependency:** Relies on WorkManager for background synchronization, which might not be available on all Android versions.

## Notes

- **Usage:** Typically instantiated and used in a long-running component like a service or application class.
- **Permissions:** Requires the `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` permission.
- **Synchronization Logic:** The actual synchronization logic is implemented in the `SyncWorker` class, which is triggered by `triggerSync()`.
