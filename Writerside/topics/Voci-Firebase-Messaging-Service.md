# Voci Firebase Messaging [Service]

## Explaination

We started implementing notifications for a part of the app that is not ready yet.
The idea is that since there are 3 nights of service a week in three different zones we wanted to create a system to let the users "subscribe" to a certain day and get notifications on the day before to remind them to make their choice if they are going to be present to the service or not.
