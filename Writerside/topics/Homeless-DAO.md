# HomelessDao [Interface]

## Overview

`HomelessDao` is an interface that defines the data access object (DAO) for interacting with the `homelesses` table in the local Room database. It provides methods for performing various database operations, such as inserting, updating, deleting, and querying homeless data.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations:** Offers methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting homeless entities in the database.
- **Data Queries:** Provides methods for querying homeless data based on different criteria, such as ID, area, or retrieving all entries.

## Key Components

- **Insert Methods:** `insert` - for adding new homeless entities to the database.
- **Update Methods:** `update`, `updateAll` - for modifying existing homeless entities.
- **Delete Methods:** `deleteById` - for removing homeless entities from the database by ID.
- **Query Methods:**
    - `getHomelessById`: Retrieves a single homeless entity by ID.
    - `getAllHomeless`: Retrieves all homeless entities as a Flow.
    - `getAllHomelessesSnapshot`: Retrieves all homeless entities as a List.
    - `getHomelessesByArea`: Retrieves homeless entities filtered by area as a Flow.

## Known Limitations

- **Data Validation:** Assumes that data validation is performed before calling DAO methods.
- **Error Handling:** Does not explicitly handle database errors, relying on Room's exception handling mechanisms.

## Notes

- **Dependencies:** Relies on Room annotations and the `Homeless` data class.
- **Future Improvements:**
    - Add data validation checks within DAO methods.
    - Implement more specific error handling for database operations.
    - Consider adding methods for more complex queries or data manipulations.
